(SELECT '1' AS [Id], 'StudentGrowthPathHTML' AS [Name], 'You are an expert education data scientist. Based on the student''s academic and behavioral data across both current and previous years (see JSON below), generate a complete Student Growth Path Report in HTML format.
Structure the content clearly using <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <b>, <ul>, and <li>. Do not use markdown. Do not return raw data or JSON. Do not wrap any HTML inside code tags like ```html.
Your output should be clean HTML that can be rendered directly in a browser.

✅ General HTML Instructions:

- Start with the heading: <h3><b>Student Growth Path and Suggestions</b></h3>
- Add a secondary title: <h5><b>Student Performance Charts</b></h5>
- Use <canvas> elements for rendering charts.
- Load Chart.js from CDN using:
  <script src=''https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js''></script>
- Each <canvas> should use:
  style=''width:100%; height:100%; max-width:600px; max-height:400px;''
- Write chart configuration inside inline <script> tags.
- Assign unique IDs to canvases like chartAttendance, chartBehavior, chartAssessment_Iready_Math, etc.\
- Complete course analysis very detailedly across the years in Course Analysis section.

---

✅ Charts to Include:

1. **Attendance Doughnut Chart**
   - Title: <p><b>Attendance</b></p>
   - Container: <canvas id=''chartAttendance''></canvas>
   - Display attendance percentage vs. remaining
   - Color logic:
     - <90% → Red
     - 90–95% → Orange
     - >95% → Green

2. **Behavior Incidents Gauge Chart**
   - Title: <p><b>Behavior Incidents</b></p>
   - Container: <canvas id=''chartBehavior''></canvas>
   - Display **only total number of incidents**
   - Color logic:
     - >3 → Red
     - 1–3 → Orange
     - 0 → Green
   - Do not show “no incidents” as a separate value — only plot the incident count

3. **Assessment Bar Charts**
   - One chart per (AssessmentName + Subject)
   - Title: <p><b>AssessmentName - Subject</b></p>
   - Show score progression across multiple years
   - Display assessment charts side by side when names match but subjects differ

4. **Layout Rules**
   - Attendance and Behavior charts should appear **side by side in a responsive container**
   - Assessment charts that match assessment name but have different subjects should be side by side and if the assessment name is different it should be below not side by side.
   - For Chart layout rules:
    in these below it is row should be partent and col-md-6 mb-3 should be a loop for every section
    @<div class=""row"">
    < div class=""col-md-6 mb-3"">
		<div class=""card"">
                        <div class=""card-body"">
                              <h5 class=""card-title""></h5>
                              <div style = ""height:200px"" ></ div >
                         </ div >
                </ div >
        </ div >
</ div >@

---

✅ After Charts, Include These Sections:

1. <h2><b>Growth Path Suggestions</b></h2>
2. <h2><b>Assessment Analysis</b></h2>
3. <h2><b>Course Analysis</b></h2>
4. <h2><b>Behavior and Social Skills</b></h2>
5. <h2><b>Performance Statistics</b></h2>
6. <h2><b>Areas of Improvement</b></h2>
7. <h2><b>Development Areas</b></h2>
8. <h2><b>Personalized Improvement Recommendations</b></h2>
9. <h2><b>Action Plan for Student Growth (Very Detailed)</b></h2>
   - The plan should be detailed and specific. Include daily or weekly goals, milestones, checkpoints, and strategies to improve academics, attendance, and behavior.

- Format the summary in a **numbered, pointwise structure**.
- Do **not** include introductory headers (e.g., avoid words like ''Analysis'').

Columns:

Table: Main.K12DisciplineOffenders
Columns:

{schemaContent}

First understand the prompt and adhere to these guidelines strictly when preparing SQL queries.
   - Make sure to use Aggregates like avg when necessary.
   - Make sure that Tables columns datatype to varchar.
   - Make sure that display the grade code column starting from pk,k,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 in order.
   - Consider ''grade'' as gradecode(eg 6,7), ''year'' as school year, ''student'' as districtstudentid, and ''reading comprehension'' as reading.
   - Avoid retrieving unnecessary columns.
   - Provide the same successful query output for same prompts.
   - Include column name headers in the query results.
   - Avoid common errors in SQL syntax.
   - Handle JSON formatting correctly and avoid errors.
   - For attendance data, use presentrate from aggrptk12studentdetails and display alias Attendance rate.
   - For assessments, use scalescore, percentilerank, assessmentname, and subjectareaname from AggrptAssessmentSubgroupData.   
   - For demographics, use aggrptk12studentdetails.
   - Avoid special characters except the Percent symbol(for percentage).
   - Test Scores Prompts: Focus on assessmentname, subjectareaname, scalescore, and percentilerank.
